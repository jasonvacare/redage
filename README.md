## TO DO LIST

1. Items  
2. Features
  A. Need compendium of feats
  B. Need compendium of class features (display class features nested under class, similar to spells by level?)
3. Spells
  A. Compendium of spells
4. Resources
  A. Compandiumize
5. NPC / monster actor sheets
6. Compendium-ize 
  A. Build the compendium of weapons and armor (and a few misc gear and example treasures)

Bells & Whistles

1. Status Effects
2. Dynamic Interactions
  A. Inventory Panoply
  B. Inventory Effects (gauntlets of ogre strength)
3. How to make the player view of a sheet different than the compendium entry view
  A. For example, make a weapon forceful and/or finesse in the compendium, and the player view enforces that
4. Weapon and spell roll interstial dialogs
   A. Weapon dialog needs to be fancied up a bit (supremacy, sneak attack, etc)
5. Item / spell / class / feature icons
6. Visually note on stat block when dex/DEX are lowered by armor.
7. Display info/controls on item entries in the actor list w/o going into the item sheet
  A. set location, see isProf / prof group, see weapon dmg, armor value, armor dex max
8. Rest Button
9. Separate "party" actor type that can hold stuff
  A. "Return To Town" Button on party to calculate loot
  B. Can store monster and other sources of XP from the expedition
10. Interstitial dialog for actor-features.  When you click the + to add a new item, it gives you a dialog to choose the type of feat (skill, rollable, resource, etc)

Odds & Ends
- Don't allow more than one copy of a class (also feature?) in your inventory.  When you drag a class in that you
already have, increment the level of the existing one.  (see DnD5e code for this)
- Better UI design for feat point subtype tracking

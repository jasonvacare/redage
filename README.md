2. Features
  A. Need compendium of feats
  C. Need compendium of class features (display class features nested under class, similar to spells by level?)

    iv. Rogue feats
  D. Feat points (total and spent, like levels?)
3. Spells

Hard Mode

1. Status Effects
2. Dynamic Interactions
  A. Inventory Panoply
  B. Inventory Effects (gauntlets of ogre strength)
3. How to make the player view of a sheet different than the compendium entry view
  A. For example, make a weapon forceful and/or finesse in the compendium, and the player view enforces that
4. Weapon and spell roll interstial dialogs
   A. Weapon dialog is in, needs to be fancied up a bit (+A/D, supremacy, sneak attack, etc options)
5. Get array-based lists working (e.g. weapon/armor qualities, etc)
6. Item / spell / class / feature icons
7. Visually note on stat block when dex/DEX are lowered by armor.
8. Color code too-many-readied-items and load level 
9. Display info/controls on item entries in the actor list w/o going into the item sheet
  A. set location, see isProf / prof group, see weapon dmg, armor value, armor dex max
10. Rearrange inventory items (drag-drop, arrows) w/in limits of sorting for the item type

Odds & Ends
- Don't allow more than one copy of a class (also feature?) in your inventory.  When you drag a class in that you
already have, increment the level of the existing one.  (see DnD5e code for this)

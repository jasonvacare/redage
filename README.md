Hard Mode

1. Status Effects
2. Dynamic Interactions
  A. Inventory Panoply
  B. Inventory Effects (gauntlets of ogre strength)
3. How to make the player view of a sheet different than the compendium entry view
  A. For example, make a weapon forceful and/or finesse in the compendium, and the player view enforces that
4. Full weapon and spell roll interstial dialog with all the +A/D, supremacy, sneak attack, etc options
5. Get array-based lists working (e.g. weapon/armor qualities, etc)
6. Item / spell / class / feature icons

Odds & Ends
- Don't allow more than one copy of a class (also feature?) in your inventory.  When you drag a class in that you
already have, increment the level of the existing one.

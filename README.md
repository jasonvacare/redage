Hard Mode

1. Status Effects
2. Dynamic Interactions
  A. Inventory Panoply
  B. Inventory Effects (gauntlets of ogre strength)
3. How to make the player view of a sheet different than the compendium entry view
  A. For example, make a weapon forceful and/or finesse in the compendium, and the player view enforces that
4. Full weapon and spell roll interstial dialog with all the +A/D, supremacy, sneak attack, etc options
5. Get array-based lists working (e.g. weapon/armor qualities, etc)
6. Item / spell / class / feature icons
7. Visually note on stat block when dex/DEX are lowered by armor.
8. Change item location from select on inventory list, without having to go into item sheet
9. Color code too-many-readied-items and load level 
10. Display info/controls on item entries in the actor list w/o going into the item sheet
  A. set location, see isProf / prof group, see weapon dmg, armor value, armor dex max
11. Rearrange inventory items (drag-drop, arrows) w/in limits of sorting for the item type

Odds & Ends
- Don't allow more than one copy of a class (also feature?) in your inventory.  When you drag a class in that you
already have, increment the level of the existing one.

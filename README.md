## TO DO LIST

1. Items  
2. Features
  A. Need compendium of feats
  B. Need compendium of class features (display class features nested under class, similar to spells by level?)
3. Spells
  A. Compendium of spells
  B. Rollable spell entries (auto-decrement mana?)
  C. Spell inventory sorting (and in-location ordinal rearranging)
  D. Spell origin (sorc, malison, world-affinity, divine bond; reflect divine bond rating as Pow cap)
4. Resources
  A. Wounds
  B. Fatigue
  C. Mana (and reserve)  
  D. Effects / Statuses
5. Rest Button
6. Panoply Checkboxes
7. "Return To Town" Button to calculate loot
8. NPC / monster actor sheets
9. Compendium-ize 
  A. Build the compendium of weapons and armor (and a few misc gear and example treasures)

Hard Mode

1. Status Effects
2. Dynamic Interactions
  A. Inventory Panoply
  B. Inventory Effects (gauntlets of ogre strength)
3. How to make the player view of a sheet different than the compendium entry view
  A. For example, make a weapon forceful and/or finesse in the compendium, and the player view enforces that
4. Weapon and spell roll interstial dialogs
   A. Weapon dialog needs to be fancied up a bit (+A/D, supremacy, sneak attack, etc options)
5. Get array-based lists working (e.g. weapon/armor qualities, etc)
6. Item / spell / class / feature icons
7. Visually note on stat block when dex/DEX are lowered by armor.
8. Display info/controls on item entries in the actor list w/o going into the item sheet
  A. set location, see isProf / prof group, see weapon dmg, armor value, armor dex max

Odds & Ends
- Don't allow more than one copy of a class (also feature?) in your inventory.  When you drag a class in that you
already have, increment the level of the existing one.  (see DnD5e code for this)
- Better UI design for feat point subtype tracking

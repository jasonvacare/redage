## TO DO LIST

1. Items  
2. Features
  A. Need compendium of feats
  B. Need compendium of class features (display class features nested under class, similar to spells by level?)
3. Spells
  A. Compendium of spells
4. Resources
  A. Compandiumize
5. NPC / monster actor sheets
6. Compendium-ize 
  A. Build the compendium of weapons and armor (and a few misc gear and example treasures)

Bells & Whistles

1. Status Effects
2. Dynamic Interactions
  A. Inventory Panoply
  B. Inventory Effects (gauntlets of ogre strength)
3. How to make the player view of a sheet different than the compendium entry view
  A. For example, make a weapon forceful and/or finesse in the compendium, and the player view enforces that
4. Weapon and spell roll interstial dialogs
   A. Weapon dialog needs to be fancied up a bit (supremacy, sneak attack, etc)
5. Item / spell / class / feature icons
6. Visually note on stat block when dex/DEX are lowered by armor.
7. Reconsider actor-items, -feats, and -spells line item displays; what info to display and how best to do so?
  A. flag non-proficient weapons
  B. weapon prof grounds?  damage?
  C. armor value, dex max?
  D. spell info?
8. Rest Button
  A. Refreshes feats / feat resources based on recharge type
  B. Optionally handles fatigue removal (checkbox)
9. Interstitial dialog for actor-features.  When you click the + to add a new item, it gives you a dialog to choose the type of feat (skill, rollable, resource, etc)
10. Containers
  A. Items can be "in a container", which itself has a location.  Containers don't themselves weigh anything
  B. All items in the container have its location override their own, swapping the container location moves all the items in it
  C. Add a "on the ground" item location below stowed (or in its own tier, like camp?), so you can put things down in the dungeon

Odds & Ends
- Don't allow more than one copy of a class (also feature?) in your inventory.  When you drag a class in that you
already have, increment the level of the existing one.  (see DnD5e code for this)
- Better UI design for feat point subtype tracking
- Can you make a macro from a non-item (like defense, stat roll, resource manager, etc)?  Can you write a macro so it triggers a button / function?
